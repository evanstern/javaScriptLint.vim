javaScriptLint.vim
==================

A port of the original [javaScriptLint.vim](git@github.com:evanstern/javaScriptLint.vim.git) plugin. This one is set up to be installed and used with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

I make no promises that this will work for you (it works for me) and I'm fairly sure that the version of javaScriptLint.vim that is included here has been slightly patched by me at some point in the last few years. So, things may or may not work well for you...

# Install

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
$ cd ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone git@github.com:evanstern/javaScriptLint.vim.git
```
